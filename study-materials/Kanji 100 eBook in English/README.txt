Thank you for downloading our 100 Kanji Lesson Pack!  

The /MP3 folder contains 100 sound files for each of the kanji covered.  Each file begins with the ON ("Chinese") reading then KUN (native Japanese) reading.  This is followed by the examples and example sentence.  

The files were all recorded by a native Japanese speech actress. (That would be Yumi!)

For your convenience, we are also including versions in Kindle's format and EPub format for the Nook and other readers.  Also for your convenience, everything is totally DRM free. Please, please do not share with others. Your support means so much to us.
